# Why a Gerrit User Summit in Europe?

We want to engage with a *wider and more diverse community*, who can bring
new requirements and needs from of the European Gerrit Community;
an opportunity to *see more faces and get new ideas*.
From a poll for the Gerrit community hereâ€™s what we found out that some
70% of the polled base would participate in a London event. There is clearly
a meaningful part of the Gerrit use base that is European based and not served
well by the US based events.

**Gerrit interest and adoption around the world**

See below a heatmap of the results of the polls on the interest of having a Gerrit User Summit this year.
