# Mining Gerrit Data to Study Contentious Reviews and Community Evolution

Software teams that use Gerrit are quickly accumulating data about their code
reviewing processes. The [Software REBELs](http://rebels.ece.mcgill.ca/)—a
research lab at McGill University—mine code review data to study topics like the
impact that code review practices have on software release and design quality.
Our more recent work mines code review data to study the reviewing process
itself. In this talk, I will describe the results of two empirical studies of
data that we collected from the Gerrit instances of the OpenStack project. The
first study aims to understand the reviews where reviewers disagree about a
patch. The second study follows how the concerns that reviewers raise evolve as
the OpenStack community ages and individual reviews accrue experience.
