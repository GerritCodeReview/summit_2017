# Diffy with enterprise grade

Since 2012 CollabNet is working on improving Gerrit integration
with TeamForge. Many features has been created to satisfy
the needs of enterprise customers. In this talk I will present
features like RBAC, history protection, Git style notifications,
quality gates, pull request and code browser which have been
implemented on top of vanilla Gerrit.
