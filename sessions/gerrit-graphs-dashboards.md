# Gerrit Analytics: dashboards, networks, KPI

Last year we introduced the Gerrit Analytics plugin for
exporting precious information from your projects and reviews.

GerritForge moved forward by introducing a comprehensive set of 
dashboards and extracting the KPI of your Review + CI/CD Pipeline.

See how you can extra and correlate data about:
- People and Teams and their relationships
- Projects, Reviews, and Commits
- System metrics
