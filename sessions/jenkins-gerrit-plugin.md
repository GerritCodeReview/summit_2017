# A new simpler but powerful Gerrit Jenkins plugin

After two years of iterations and improvements over the Gerrit CI workflow
it is about time to consolidate the knowledge into a brand-new plugin.

See in action the new Gerrit Multi-Branch integration with Jenkins Pipeline:
- zero configuration on Jenkins
- based on WebHooks triggers
- integrated with Jenkinsfile
- seamless view in BlueOcean
